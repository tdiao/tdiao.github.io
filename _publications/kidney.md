# excerpt: '**Abstract:** Candidates awaiting renal transplant must quickly respond to kidney offers, either accepting it or declining in hopes of an upcoming better offer. To facilitate that decision, we observed survival times after deceased-donor kidney offers were either accepted or declined, by kidney quality, candidate health and time on the waitlist. Those survival times and rates for similar candidates were consistently better if they accepted than if they declined, and sometimes significantly better (+20.4 months on average and +15% in 10-year survival). Because accepting an offer reduces the time most candidates will spend on dialysis, it can also improve their quality of life. We analyzed 184,072 waitlisted candidates, including 132,271 deceased-donor kidney transplant recipients, receiving 17,548,715 offers between 2000 and 2019 listed in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. Kidney quality and candidate health were measured by the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) and the Estimated Post Transplant Survival (EPTS) score. When the survival time of candidates was not observable, we used a Kaplan-Meier estimate. Our results extend previous work to include complete offer histories and candidates who did not receive kidney transplants.  These results suggest the circumstances under which candidates should be most aggressive in accepting organ offers.'
