title: "Towards More Consistent Liver Transplant Decisions in the Presence of COVID-19 (Working paper)"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/transplantCOVID
excerpt: 'We take a principled analytical approach to the surgeon’s decision of whether to perform a particular liver transplant when the patient might die from COVID-19. Our model can help surgeons make such decisions under uncertainty more consistently based on their judgments about the donor organ and their patient’s health and circumstances.'
