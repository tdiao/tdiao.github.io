I am pursuing a Ph.D. in [Decision and Risk Analysis](https://dara.stanford.edu/) within Management Science & Engineering and a Ph.D. Minor in [Computer Science](https://cs.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University. My research develops the principled ways to apply machine learning and/or artificial intelligence in domains of medicine and environmental sciences. I believe in decision-driven data acquisition and analyses, not the other way round. 

My previous research interests include decision analysis in social entrepreneurship and modeling matching & pricing with friction between investors and entrepreneurs. Before graduate school, my full-time professional experiences were in pension consulting and personal property & casualty insurance lines. 

I hold an M.S. in Management Science & Engineering (technical and engineering management) from Stanford University and B.A.s in Statistics and Economics from University of California - Berkeley. I passed four [Society of Actuaries](https://www.soa.org/) examinations.
