I am a data scientist, researcher, and engineer in training. I believe in decision-driven data acquisition, analyses, and modeling, not the other way round.

As a modeling data scientist in [AI Labs @BlackRock Inc.](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/ai), I apply machine learning, convex optimization, and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) techniques to provide actionable insights for partner teams, such as portfolio managers and risk managers. 

I received my PhD in [Decision and Risk Analysis](https://dara.stanford.edu/) from Management Science & Engineering (MS&E) and a PhD minor in [Computer Science](https://cs.stanford.edu/) from Stanford University. My PhD thesis was on values-driven decision support for deceased-donor kidney transplant decisions. I hold an MS in technical and engineering management from MS&E and BAs (double major) in Statistics and Economics from University of California - Berkeley.

My previous research interests include decision analysis in social entrepreneurship and modeling matching & pricing with friction between investors and entrepreneurs. Before graduate school, my full-time professional experiences were in pension consulting and personal property & casualty insurance lines. I passed four [Society of Actuaries](https://www.soa.org/) examinations:
* Exam 1/Probability
* Exam 2/Financial Mathematics
* Exam LC/Models for Life Contingencies
* Exam 4/Construction and Evaluation of Actuarial Models


I hold an M.S. in Management Science & Engineering (technical and engineering management) from Stanford University and B.A.s in Statistics and Economics from University of California - Berkeley.
