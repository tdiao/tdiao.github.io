title: "Newspaper GAL: Newspaper Generation and Analysis of Leaning (with S. Bea and L. Neustock)"
excerpt: "The aim of this project is twofold. Firstly, we detect bias in newspaper articles and in their corresponding the Facebook comments by applying sentiment analysis. The results confirm different leanings in newspaper sources. Secondly, the dataset is used to create a comprehensive “Must-Read” list for a news topic incorporating different viewpoints, achieving greater coverage of opinions while remaining overall neutral."
